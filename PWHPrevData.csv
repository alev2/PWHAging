Footnote(s): Data for 2022 and 2023 are considered preliminary (subject to a 12-month reporting delay). Inclusion of preliminary data in trend assessments is discouraged. Numbers less than 12͵ and rates and percentages based on these numbers͵ should be interpreted with caution. HIV diagnoses and PrEP data for the year 2020͵ which coincided with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic͵ should be interpreted with caution due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on access to HIV testing͵ PrEP prescriptions͵ and care-related services. Data by transmission category presented based on sex assigned at birth and are adjusted for missing transmission category. County-level data for Connecticut are temporarily not available due to the transition from counties to planning regions. County-level data for HIV diagnoses and linkage to HIV care for Connecticut have been set to ‘Data Not Available’ for years 2022 and 2023. See Technical notes for more details on data availability and stratifications.
   Prevalence data for the year 2022 are preliminary and based on death data received by CDC as of December 2022. Prevalence data prior to 2010 are based on residence at diagnosis; prevalence data from 2010 to present are based on most recent known address. See Technical Notes for death reporting by jurisdiction.
   ^ Jurisdiction with incomplete reporting of deaths for most recent year.
   The 'Sex' column is used for either sex at birth or gender identity.
