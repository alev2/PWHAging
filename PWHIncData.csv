Title: "Estimated HIV incidence | 2010 | 2011 | 2012 | 2013 | 2014 | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 (COVID-19 Pandemic) | 2021 | United States | All races/ethnicities | Both sexes | 13-24 | 25-34 | 35-44 | 45-54 | 55+ | All transmission categories""
Footnote(s): Data for 2022 and 2023 are considered preliminary (subject to a 12-month reporting delay). Inclusion of preliminary data in trend assessments is discouraged. Numbers less than 12͵ and rates and percentages based on these numbers͵ should be interpreted with caution. HIV diagnoses and PrEP data for the year 2020͵ which coincided with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic͵ should be interpreted with caution due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on access to HIV testing͵ PrEP prescriptions͵ and care-related services. Data by transmission category presented based on sex assigned at birth and are adjusted for missing transmission category. County-level data for Connecticut are temporarily not available due to the transition from counties to planning regions. County-level data for HIV diagnoses and linkage to HIV care for Connecticut have been set to ‘Data Not Available’ for years 2022 and 2023. See Technical notes for more details on data availability and stratifications.
   Estimates with an RSE>50% are statistically unreliable and reported as data not available.
   * Estimates with an RSE of 30%–50% should be used with caution because they do not meet the standard of reliability.
   The 'Sex' column is used for either sex at birth or gender identity.
   NA - Not applicable.
